                  A French iOS developer. I first noticed Apple's ecosystem back in 2010. Something about it caught my attention, but I ended up pursuing audio instead. Years later, that curiosity came back stronger than ever, so I decided to dive in.

                <p>
                  I committed to spending many hours every day for 8 months learning Swift, SwiftUI, and Apple's frameworks. My goal was to really master the fundamentals. There's still so much I want to learn, and honestly, I can't wait to keep growing! But that drive and persistence is what pushes me forward every day.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I've shipped one app to the App Store, built another open-source project, and I'm currently working on a third app to explore and master modular architecture in SwiftUI. My audio background taught me to dig deep into documentation and experiment relentlessly until I truly understand how things work. Now I'm looking to bring that same curiosity and persistence to a junior SwiftUI developer role.
